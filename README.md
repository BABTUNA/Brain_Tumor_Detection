### Project Level: Intermediate-Advanced
### Dataset: [Brain Tumor Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
### Main Libraries: Numpy, Padnas, Matplotlib, Keras
### Project Overview: 
This following project uses an image brain tumor dataset found on Kaggle for a deep learning classfication model. After creating the preprocessing function, the dataset can be increased to produce a better learning model. Utlizing the Keras Tensorflow libray, we make a convolutional neural network model to make classifications for the provided dataset.
